Title: Bindings for 'Mapbox' Ear Cutting Triangulation Library 
Description: Provides constrained triangulation of polygons. Ear cutting (or 
 ear clipping) applies constrained triangulation by successively 'cutting'
 triangles from a polygon defined by path/s. Holes are supported by introducing
 a bridge segment between polygon paths. This package wraps the 'header-only' 
 library 'earcut.hpp' <https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp.git> which includes
 a reference to the method used by Held, M. (2001) <doi:10.1007/s00453-001-0028-4>.
